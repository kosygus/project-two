        The most effective way to hinder the impact of fast fashion is to stop
        supporting it. <br />
        Here are some tips to spot fast fashion:
      </b></i>
    </p>
    <p class="futurep">
      - Thousands of styles, which touch on all the latest trends. <br />
      - Extremely short turnaround time between when a trend or garment is seen
      on the catwalk, or in celebrity media, and when it hits the shelves.
      <br />
      - Offshore manufacturing where labour is the cheapest, with the use of
      workers on low wages without adequate rights or safety, as well as complex
      supply chains with poor visibility beyond the first tier and of
      subcontracting. <br />
