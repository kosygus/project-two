    <p class="faqsp"><b> <i>What should I do with my old clothes? </b> </i> <br>
        Donate any clothes you no longer wear! Never just <br> 
        throw them away. Whether it is to a local homeless shelter, or just <br> 
        the Goodwill - donate, donate, donate.<br>
        <br> 
        <b> <i>Where should I buy my clothes? </b> </i> <br>
        Purchase clothing from sustainable brands. Sustainable <br> 
        brands do tend to run a bit expensive, however. If you find <br> 
        yourself unable to buy from sustainable brands - go thrift shopping! <br>
        Second hand stores not only help the planet out, but they also help <br>
         out your wallet. It is a win-win situation, and you never know what you might find! <br>
