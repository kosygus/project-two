      Cheap textiles also increase fast fashion’s impact. <br />
      Polyester is one of the most popular fabrics. <br />
      It is derived from fossil fuels, contributes to global warming, <br />
      and can shed microfibres that add to the increasing levels <br />
      of plastic in our oceans when it’s put through the wash. <br />
      But even “natural fabrics” can be a problem at the scale <br />
      fast fashion demands. Conventional cotton requires <br />
      enormous quantities of water and pesticides in developing <br />
      countries. This results in risks of drought and creates huge<br />
      amounts of stress on water basins, as well as competition <br />
      for resources between companies and local communities.
