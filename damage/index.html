      Cheap textiles also increase fast fashion’s impact. Polyester is one of
      the most popular faics. It is derived from fossil fuels, contributes to
      global warming, and can shed microfies that add to the increasing levels
      of plastic in our oceans when it’s put through the wash.

      But even “natural faics” can be a problem at the scale fast fashion
      demands. Conventional cotton requires enormous quantities of water and
      pesticides in developing countries. This results in risks of drought and
      creates huge amounts of stress on water basins, as well as competition for
      resources between companies and local communities.
